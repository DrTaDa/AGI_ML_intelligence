# Advances toward AGI and the understanding of intelligence

Repository of resources about progresses toward the understanding of human intelligence and artificial general intelligence (AGI). I am not interested here specifically about the progresses and research made in machine learning however some research on ML might be relevant to the discussion.
I will not discuss here the dangers/ethical issues raised by the use of AGI/AI/ML.

I will try to provide links pointing to open resources whenever possible, but some articles might require access through your institution.

I will section, I will put forward works that have allowed significant progress toward the understanding of intelligence or the development of an AGI. I will give priority to works that present **general theories or models** of intelligence rather than specialized studies.
